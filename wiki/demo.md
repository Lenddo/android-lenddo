# Running the Demo Application



## Mobile Data Collection Demo
The first demo is the mobile data collection demo. Click this [link](datasdk_demo_v2.2.6-debug.apk) to download the apk for the demo. The user must provide an application id to identify the current session and click the button to start data collection. A random application id is already provided by the demo. The process will run in the background. If ran on an Android Marshmallow and above device, a UI for granting the permissions are displayed. Please grant all permissions to allow the application access to mobile data.



## Social Network Onboarding Demo
The second demo is a Loan Application demo app that gathers user information via Application Form that the user will need to fill up. The user will then click on the Lenddo Button to start the Social Network Onboarding process. The onboarding process of this demo will connect Facebook and Email. Other social networks can be configured in the onboarding process for the actual integration with your app. Your LenddoEFL representative should be able to assist you with this. Get a demo apk from this [link](onboarding_demo_v1.2.6-debug.apk).
